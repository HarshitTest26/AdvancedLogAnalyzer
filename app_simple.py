    - ‚úÖ **Dependencies updated**: Compatible versions installed
    - ‚ùå **Data files removed**: Log files with AWS credentials were safely removed

    ### ‚úÖ What's Working Now:
    - File upload system
    - Basic log preview
    - Secure environment (no sensitive data)
    
    ### üîÑ What's Being Fixed:
    - ML/AI analysis features (compatibility with Python 3.14)
    - Advanced log parsing
    - Report generation
    
    ### üìã Next Steps to Fully Restore:
    1. **Upload Clean Log Files**: Use log files without any sensitive data
    2. **Retrain Models**: We'll help you retrain the ML models
    3. **Rebuild Reports**: Generate new analysis reports

        **Option 1: Use this simplified version**
        - Upload your cleaned log files
        - Basic analysis available
        - Gradually restore advanced features
        
        **Option 2: Fix full version**
        - We can downgrade Python to 3.11 for better compatibility
        - Reinstall with specific package versions
        - Restore full ML capabilities
        
        **Option 3: Hybrid approach**
        - Use simple version for immediate needs  
        - Parallel full version development
        - Gradual migration when ready
